        I'm an aspiring software developer with a strong foundation in Java,
        React, and JavaScript. ? Currently in the final year of my engineering
        degree, I've been honing! my skills through various projects, from
        building robust back-end ?systems with Node.js and MongoDB to creating
        dynamic front-end interfaces? with React. I'm passionate about web
        development and have worked on! exciting projects like a Swiggy app, a
        Netflix clone, and a messaging !web app, each challenging me to grow and
        learn new technologies. I'm experienced in working with databases like
        MongoDB and have used Firebase for deploying projects. My recent focus
        has been on enhancing my skills in React and Redux, and I enjoy the
        problem-solving aspect of coding, whether it's optimizing algorithms in
        Java or designing user-friendly interfaces.
