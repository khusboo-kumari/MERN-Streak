        Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, known as the "Missile Man of India," was a
        visionary scientist, educator, and the 11th President of India from 2002
        to 2007. Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, Kalam
        played a pivotal role in India's space and missile development programs,
        notably the development of ballistic missiles and launch vehicle
        technology at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the
        Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). He was
        instrumental in the success of India's nuclear tests in 1998. Beyond his
        scientific achievements, Dr. Kalam was an inspiring leader, dedicated to
        education and youth empowerment, earning him the title of the "People's
        President." His humility, wisdom, and vision for a self-reliant India
        left an indelible mark on the nation's development. He passed away on
        July 27, 2015, but his legacy continues to inspire millions.
